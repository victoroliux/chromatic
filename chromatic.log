Retrieving git information
✖ Found only one commit
This typically means you have ran into one of the following scenarios:
- You've checked out a shallow copy of the Git repository, which some CI systems do by default.
  In order for Chromatic to correctly determine baseline commits, we need access to the full Git history graph.
  Refer to your CI provider's documentation for details.
- You've only made a single commit so far.  
  Please make at least one additional commit in order for Chromatic to be able to detect what's changed.

The CLI tried to run your build-storybook script, but the command failed. This indicates a problem with your Storybook. Here's what to do:

- Check the Storybook build log printed below.
- Run npm run build-storybook or yarn build-storybook yourself and make sure it outputs a valid Storybook by opening the generated index.html in your browser.
- Review the build-storybook CLI options at https://storybook.js.org/docs/configurations/cli-options/#for-build-storybook
